Optocoupler modelled with a LED and Mosfet.

Property: (default value)

Led:
- Fordward Voltage: (1.8 V)
   Led threshold voltage.

- Max Current: (8 mA)
   At this value we get the maximum brightness.
   Beyond this limit the LED gets damaged.
   If this current is surpassed by a significant ammount
   the LED will blink in red.

- Resistance: ( 0.6 Ω)
   LED Resistance.

Mosfet:
- RDSon (0.05 Ω)
   DS Resistance in the lower part 
   of the linear region when conducting:
   VGS > Vth and VDS < ( VGS – Vth )

- Threshold: (3 V)
   Gate-Source Voltage to start conduction.
